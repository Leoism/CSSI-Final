		&#8227; <b>Kitty Litter</b> is a game about stuff that I'm not sure of yet but there is going to be a lot of stuff here, just saying. Josh and I will figure it out later. For now this is just placebo text that should take place and be used for formatting purposes and for other things such as styling and testing out small things such as short javascript functions and what-not.
